## Introduction

Before we start coding an app, we should take the time to plan it out. What goals
would we like to accomplish through creating it? Who will use it? What problems will
this application solve? What will it look like?

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges
$ et get planning-an-app
$ cd planning-an-app
```

Open `plan.md` in your editor of choice.

## Instructions

### User Stories

Imagine you are going to create a website for bringing people with similar 
interests together (e.g. - meetups.com).

Think of a few use cases for this app. Then, write **User Stories** for this
application in `plan.md`. Make sure they fit the following format.

```no-highlight
As a ...,
I want ...,
So that ...
```

### Wireframes

What will your website look like? This is the question wireframing attempts to
answer. As web developers, we get paid to draw boxes on a screen. How will
you arrange these boxes in an eye-pleasing and functional way?

Use your tool of choice when building wireframes. There are plenty of options
when it comes to choosing a wireframing application. Pen and paper works equally
well, and you probably already have that handy. Pair that with a smartphone
and a way to share photos (imgur or Dropbox), and you're set.

Wireframe the sign up page for your meetup application and include an image in your
`plan.md` file.
